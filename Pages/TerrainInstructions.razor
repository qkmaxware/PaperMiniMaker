        <h1>How To Use</h1>
        <p class="w3-container">
            This document is intended to help you understand how to use the Papercraft Mini-Maker application when designing map or terrain elements.
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="w3-container">
            A terrain element is a gameplay token commonly used in tabletop gaming, from tabletop roleplaying games to wargames and used to provide a visual reference of things in the environment in which the game characters are in. Usually these miniatures are plastic figurines such as rocks, trees, or building. However, these pastic miniatures can be quite costly especially if one is in need of purchasing large quantities of them. Papercraft miniatures are cheep alternatives. These miniatures are static images that have been printed out and folded so that they can stand on their own paper base. This application is designed to assist those who wish to use papercraft miniatures for their tabletop gaming. It automates the layout of user artwork such that when printed it is easy to cut and fold the paper to create the miniature.

        <h2>Creation</h2>
        <div class="w3-container">
            <h3>1. Create a new miniature</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                To begin creating a new paper miniature simply click the large <b>New +</b> button on the main page. This will open a popup dialog with all the options you have available for the attributes of this miniature.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Name your mini</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                Provide a name for your miniature. For terrain miniatures this is only used for your own reference and is not printed.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Terrain element type</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                This application supports a lot of different types of terrain elements. Walls stand vertically, clips are hung on walls to provide details like doors and windows, platforms are folded to be raised above the ground, and floors are flat details to be placed on the floor such as carpets. Select the type of terrain object you would like to create. 
            </p>
            <div class="w3-panel w3-margin w3-padding w3-round-large w3-red">
                <b>Notice</b> This will change the way the object is printed as well as the folds required to complete the mini.
            </div>
            <h3>4. Select a size</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                Provide the size of the printed miniature. These sizes are multiples of the standard 1inch squares used in many tabletop games. 
            </p>
            <div class="w3-panel w3-margin w3-padding w3-round-large w3-red">
                <b>Notice</b> Not all terrain types will used all dimensions. For instance, floor tiles that are meant to be flat will ignore the height.
            </div>
            <h3>5. Replicate</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                Select the number of replicas to print. For unique terrain leave this at a default value of 1. For cases where you want to print multiple of the same terrain (such as walls) then adjust this as you see fit.    
            </p>
            <h3>6. Choose artwork</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                The last step in creating a papercraft miniature is to choose the artwork that is displayed on the miniature. When selecting artwork you can either choose an image from a web-accessible location (like google search) by providing the URL to the image file. Alternatively you can upload your own image to use for the artwork. These images are not uploaded to any server, instead javascript locally converts the image to a Data URL and uses that instead. 
            </p>
            <h3>7. Confirm</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                To confirm your settings, simply press the <b>Done</b> button at the bottom of the popup dialog window.    
                You may create as many miniatures as you want. When printed, they will all be put on the same document in order to save on paper rather than printing each on their own page.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Editing/Changing</h2>
        <div class="w3-container">
            On the main page, click on the <b>Edit</b> button under any miniature's image. This will open the same dialog window as with creating a miniature, but instead of creating a new miniature, you can edit the values of the exisiting one.
        </div>
        <h2>Assembly</h2>
        <div class="w3-container">
            <h3>1. Print</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                To build your configured miniatures, simply print the web-page. A dropdown is available at the top of the page allowing you to choose if the printed minis will be printed with or without a base. Using clever CSS tricks, the printed version of the page not have the icons and buttons that you see in the web-browser, but rather the paper miniatures themselves laid out in a way that makes them easy to fold and assemble. The app will attempt to put as many miniautures on the same page as possible.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Cut</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                Once printed, simply cut the miniatures out along the solid lines that border each miniature.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Fold</h3>
            <p class="w3-container">
                The dotted lines on each miniature represent where you should fold them. Each miniature is laid out vertically so that only horizonal folds across the horizonal axis of the paper are required.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Glue</h4>
            <p class="w3-container">
                It is recommended that you should glue any touching blank paper once the folding has been completed.
            </p>
            <h4>5. Enjoy!</h4>
